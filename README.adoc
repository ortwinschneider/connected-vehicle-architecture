The *Red Hat Connected Vehicle Architecture* is a Red Hat solution pattern that implements key aspects of a modern IoT/Edge architecture in an exemplary manner. It uses OpenShift and various middleware components optimized for a cloud-native usage. 

This architecture *can serve as a foundation for an IoT/Edge or a Software Defined Vehicle Hybrid Cloud environment* supporting various use cases like _OTA deployments, Driver monitoring, AI/ML_ and others.

It aims to *showcase an end-to-end workflow*, from connecting RHIVOS to the cloud backend, processing telemetry data in batch or as stream, *training AI/ML models* and deploying containers through a DevSecOps pipeline to the edge.
